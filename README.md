# MacroCL
OpenCL (GPU) based image alignment/macro stacking software that will -hopefully- help
macrophotographers to stack the images taken at different focus disatances into one
artifically created image.

# External libraries
MacroCL uses the SFML framework to load and save images and to do other tasks like creating main window, handling input events, etc.
